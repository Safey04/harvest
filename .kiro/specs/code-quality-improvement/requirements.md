# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the code quality of the Chicken Farm Harvest Plan Optimization System. The current codebase has grown organically and contains several code quality issues including large monolithic functions, inconsistent error handling, missing type hints, inadequate testing, and architectural violations of SOLID principles. This improvement initiative aims to refactor the codebase to industry standards while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the harvest optimization system, I want the codebase to follow SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the system without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the main.py file THEN the file SHALL be under 500 lines of code
2. WHEN reviewing class responsibilities THEN each class SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN high-level modules SHALL depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. WHEN adding new harvest types THEN the system SHALL be extensible without modifying existing code
5. WHEN examining method signatures THEN all public methods SHALL have complete type hints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the optimization algorithms, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the system, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any optimization operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
2. WHEN invalid input data is provided THEN the system SHALL raise specific, descriptive exceptions
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN optimization solver fails THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback strategies and log the attempts
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN all major operations SHALL have appropriate debug-level logging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring system reliability, I want comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all critical functionality, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all optimization algorithms SHALL have unit tests with >90% code coverage
2. WHEN testing data processing functions THEN edge cases and error conditions SHALL be covered
3. WHEN validating CSV export functionality THEN integration tests SHALL verify correct file generation
4. WHEN testing configuration classes THEN all validation logic SHALL be tested
5. WHEN running CI/CD pipelines THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the data processing pipeline, I want modular, reusable components with clear interfaces, so that I can easily test individual components and reuse them across different optimization scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining data loading logic THEN it SHALL be separated into dedicated, testable modules
2. WHEN reviewing optimization components THEN model building, solving, and solution processing SHALL be independent modules
3. WHEN analyzing CSV export functionality THEN it SHALL be abstracted into reusable components
4. WHEN adding new data sources THEN the system SHALL support them through interface implementations
5. WHEN processing different file formats THEN the system SHALL use pluggable data processors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want consistent code formatting, documentation, and naming conventions throughout the project, so that the code is readable and maintainable by the entire team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any Python file THEN it SHALL follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. WHEN examining function and class definitions THEN they SHALL have comprehensive docstrings
3. WHEN reading variable and method names THEN they SHALL be descriptive and follow Python naming conventions
4. WHEN reviewing complex algorithms THEN they SHALL have inline comments explaining the logic
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the code SHALL be self-documenting and easy to understand

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with the optimization models, I want the large monolithic functions broken down into smaller, focused functions, so that I can understand, test, and modify individual pieces of functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any function THEN it SHALL be under 50 lines of code
2. WHEN reviewing function responsibilities THEN each function SHALL have a single, clear purpose
3. WHEN analyzing complex operations THEN they SHALL be decomposed into smaller, composable functions
4. WHEN testing functionality THEN individual functions SHALL be easily unit testable
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN the call stack SHALL provide clear indication of where problems occur

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with configuration and data models, I want robust input validation and data integrity checks, so that the system fails fast with clear error messages when invalid data is provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing configuration parameters THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and provide clear error messages for invalid values
2. WHEN loading CSV data THEN the system SHALL validate required columns and data types
3. WHEN processing optimization results THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency and completeness
4. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL validate output data before writing files
5. WHEN handling date/time data THEN the system SHALL consistently parse and validate temporal information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the project dependencies, I want a clean, minimal dependency structure with proper version management, so that the project is secure, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project dependencies THEN all packages SHALL be pinned to specific versions
2. WHEN analyzing the dependency tree THEN there SHALL be no unused or redundant dependencies
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL have automated security vulnerability scanning
4. WHEN deploying the application THEN dependency installation SHALL be reproducible across environments
5. WHEN adding new dependencies THEN they SHALL be justified and documented
